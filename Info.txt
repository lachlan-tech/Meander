1,000,000 call limit per month

44,640 calls a month if you did minutely calls in a private database, you can get around the hard limit. and multiple schools can have the app, with no increase in demand off the api

far less than if 1500 people called on the website 40 times a day, including reloads, for 31 days in a month
1500*40*31 = 1,860,000 (breaks the bank) costs $4 to upgrade to get that kind of service 
multiply that by the 1000s of schools that could use it... yeh no
