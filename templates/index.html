                    AllSchools was created and founded by Woodridge State High School Student, Lachlan Nielsen, as a compilation of many programs he had written for his own school. After quickly realising the usefullness of his soulutions, he found that these projects could help make a difference in other schools, aswell as his own.

                        As any Scholar will know, the keys to success are preparedness, willingness, and empowerment. The projects I created aim to help students and teachers be more prepared for their day, and help to increase the coherent nature that all students require from a school to be able to learn in an ideal environment. By making students aware of changes happening in their day, we can help to increase the overall preparedness of students and teachers, boosting their success. Remember, knowledge is power! The more you know the better prepared you are for this new 21st century world.
